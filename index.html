        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Hershey Wayne Corvera Saim, however I choose to go by Hershey or Wayne instead of my entire name. I currently live in Poblacion Muntinlupa City at 205-B Quezon Street, the place where I was born and raised. I was born on April 4, 2003, making me an Aries. I'm grateful that my family is the kind that is kind, joyful, and especially entertaining. We're a family of four girls, and I'm the third. My mother got up at three in the morning to do chores and prepare food so that we would be ready to eat when we woke up. I'm grateful that she is my mother. My father is a strong man who can handle a lot around the house, including some of my mother's tasks. He and my mother go above and beyond the call of duty to raise us to be successful and humble individuals. My father may work as a mechanic overseas, which limits our time together because he works so hard for us. I'm so grateful that I have parents who put their needs before their own. The school I went to was here in Muntinlupa when I started kindergarten, but from first grade to fifth grade, I went to Bacolod, whereas both of my grandparents live, and from sixth grade to senior high school, I returned to Muntinlupa I  attend Muntinlupa National High School (Main), and I'm in my second year of college at my beloved Plmun.  My goals for this course, HUMCOMP, are to gain a deeper understanding of how humans and computers interact. In five years, I believe myself as a successful businesswoman with several types of international branches, some investments, and other people interested in franchising my brand.</p>
